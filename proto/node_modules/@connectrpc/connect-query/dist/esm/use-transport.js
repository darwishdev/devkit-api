/**
 * `TransportProvider` is the main mechanism by which Connect-Query keeps track of the `Transport` used by your application.
 *
 * Broadly speaking, "transport" joins two concepts:
 *
 *   1. The protocol of communication.  For this there are two options: the {@link https://connectrpc.com/docs/protocol/ Connect Protocol}, or the {@link https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md gRPC-Web Protocol}.
 *   1. The protocol options.  The primary important piece of information here is the `baseUrl`, but there are also other potentially critical options like request credentials and binary wire format encoding options.
 *
 * With these two pieces of information in hand, the transport provides the critical mechanism by which your app can make network requests.
 *
 * To learn more about the two modes of transport, take a look at the npm package `@connectrpc/connect-web`.
 *
 * To get started with Connect-Query, simply import a transport (either `createConnectTransport` or `createGrpcWebTransport` from `@connectrpc/connect-web`) and pass it to the provider.
 *
 * @example
 * import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
 * import { TransportProvider } from "@connectrpc/connect-query";
 *
 * const queryClient = new QueryClient();
 *
 * export const App() {
 *   const transport = createConnectTransport({
 *     baseUrl: "<your baseUrl here>",
 *   });
 *   return (
 *     <TransportProvider transport={transport}>
 *       <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
 *          <YourApp />
 *       </QueryClientProvider>
 *     </TransportProvider>
 *   );
 * }
